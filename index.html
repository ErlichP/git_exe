               <p>
                This is an easy method that is helpful for multiplying any number by 9. Here is how it works:
               </p>

               <p>Let&#8217s use the example of 9 x 5.</p>
               <p><br>
                <b>Step 1:</b>  Subtract 1 from the number that is being multiplied by 9.
               </p><br>
            <code> 5 &#8722 1 = 4</code><br>
           
               <br><p>The number 4 is the first number in the answer to the equation.</p><br>

               <p><b>Step 2:</b>  Subtract that number from the number 9.</p><br>
               <code>9 &#8722 4 = 5</code><br><br>
               <p>The number 5 is the second number in the answer to the equation.</p><br>

               <p>So, 9 x 5 = 45</p>

            <p>With the help of basic principles of tens and unit places, the addition of two-digit numbers is performed by</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take 63 + 32</li>
                <li>Split the second number into tens and unit places.</li>
                <code> 32 = 30 + 2</code>
                <li>Finish the ten&#8217s addition</li>
                <code>63 + 30 = 93</code>
                <li>Finally, add the remaining unit place digit.</li>
                <code>93 + 2 = 95.</code>

            <p>Here is an example that requires a lot of borrowing</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consider two numbers say 1000 and 676</li>
                <li>Subtract 1 from both the numbers; we get 999 and 675</li>
                <li>Then subtract 675 from 999, we get 324</li>
                <li>So, </li>
                <code>1000 &#8722 676 = 324.</code>

            <p>The numbers that can be evenly divided by certain numbers are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If a number is an even number and ends in 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8, it is divided by 2.</li>
                <li>A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3. Consider the number 12 = 1 + 3 and 3 is divisible by 3.</li>
                <li>A number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits are divisible by 4. Example: 9312. Here the last two digits are 12, and 12 is divisible by 4.</li>
                <li>If the last digit is 0 or 5, it is divisible by 5</li>
                <li>If a number is divisible by 2 and 3, then it is divisible by 6, since 6 is the product of 2 and 3.</li>
                <li>If the number is divisible by 8, the last three digits of the numbers are divisible by 8.</li>
                <li>If a number is divisible by 9, the sum of the digits is divided by 9. Let us consider the example, 4518 = 4 + 5 + 1 + 8 = 18, which is divisible by 9.</li>
                <li>If the final digit of the number is 0, it is divisible by 10.</li>
            </ul>

           <header>Maths Trick to Find Percentage</header>
           <p>Finding a percentage of a number can be somewhat tricky, but thinking about it in the right terms makes it much easier to understand. For instance, to find out what 5% of 235 is, follow this method:</p><br>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Step 1: </b>Move the decimal point over by one place, 235 becomes 23.5. </li><br>
            <li><b>Step 2: </b>  Divide 23.5 by the number 2, the answer is 11.75. That is also the answer to the original equation.</li>
        </ul>
