  <h3 id='headline'>Alexander Graham Bell Timeline</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1847</strong> -Alexander Graham Bell is born on March 3, 1847, in Edinburgh, Scotland.</li>
    <li><strong>1868–73</strong> -Bell gains admission to University College, London. He does not complete his studies there, however. Shortly after, in 1870, Bell’s family moves to Ontario, Canada. Because his mother is deaf and his father teaches deaf students, Bell wants to teach hearing-impaired students. While teaching at an American school for deaf children in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1873, Bell meets Mabel Hubbard, daughter of future telephone investor Gardiner Greene Hubbard. (Mabel would eventually marry Bell in 1877.)</li>
     <li><strong>Mid-1870s</strong> -Bell becomes interested in communications technology, especially how to make telegraph messaging more sophisticated. He and other inventors, working independently, develop technology that is capable of telegraphing harmonic sounds. Soon Bell turns his attention to developing the technology to transmit human voices.</li>
      <li><strong>1876–77</strong> -On March 7, 1876, Bell receives a patent on technology that would transmit the human voice: the telephone. Despite having the patent, Bell does not yet have a fully functioning instrument. Three days later Bell makes the first successful test of the telephone. Led by Gardiner Greene Hubbard, a group of investors eventually establishes the Bell Telephone Company in July 1877 to bring Bell’s telephone into widespread use and, thus, to revolutionize person-to-person communication.</li>
       <li><strong>1880s</strong> -Not content with merely revolutionizing human communication, Bell later turns his attention to the technology of sound recording and playback. In 1880 Bell is awarded the French government’s Volta Prize of 50,000 francs for his invention of the telephone. He uses the money to set up the Volta Laboratory in Washington, D.C., an institution devoted to improving the lives of the hearing impaired. His studies in sound playback eventually lead to his invention (1885) of a device called the Graphophone, which is a refinement of the phonograph. Bell uses proceeds from the sale of patents for the Graphophone to endow the Volta Laboratory. During this period Bell also develops the electrical bullet probe, an early version of the metal detector, for surgical use.</li>
        <li><strong>1888–1903</strong> -Bell becomes a founding member of the National Geographic Society in 1888. He succeeds his father-in-law as president in 1898. Bell serves as president for five years.</li>
         <li><strong>1907</strong> -Bell founds the Aerial Experiment Association, which makes significant advances in the design and control of early aircraft.</li>
         <li><strong>1922</strong> -Bell dies on August 2, 1922, at his estate on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, Canada. During his funeral service, every telephone of the Bell system in the United States and Canada is kept silent for one minute in his honor.</li>
